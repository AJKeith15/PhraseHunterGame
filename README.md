The phrase hunter app uses two object classes which are instantiated to create the game instance and the phrase object. The game picks a random phrase from a list of five, all having to do with Javascript, and puts the letters onto the game board as blank spaces. The user can either click on the keyboard buttons on-screen or use their keyboard to type out their guesses. The user has 5 lives which will disappear if an incorrect letter is chosen. If the user loses all lives, a screen will be displayed revealing the correct phrase. If the user guesses correctly, a winning screen is displayed. Regardless of the outcome, the user can choose to start a new game afterwards.

A few small extras were added to this project to give it some personal flair. A note was added under the game header to describe the types of phrases (this was colored to match the game header). There was also a note just above the keyboard that tells the user that they can use their keyboard to type out guesses. The "Start Game" button was changed to "Start New Game" after the user reaches the win/lose screen as I thought it sounded better than saying "Start Game" again. Lastly, the keyboard buttons change to green when a correct letter is guessed and a gray color when guessed incorrectly.
